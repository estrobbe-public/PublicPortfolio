Overview
In this hands-on lab you learn how to set up a Layer 7 (L7) application load balancer on Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs). L7 load balancers can understand HTTP(S) protocols, allowing them to make routing decisions based on parameters like URL, headers, cookies, and the content of the request. This allows for improved application performance and responsiveness.

There are several ways you can load balance on Google Cloud. This lab takes you through the setup of the following load balancers:

Setup and requirements
Before you click the Start Lab button
Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
Note: Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.
Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
Note: Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.

Task 1. Set the default region and zone for all resources
Set the default region:

gcloud config set compute/region us-east1
Copied!
In Cloud Shell, set the default zone:

gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-c
Copied!
Learn more about choosing zones and regions in Compute Engine's Regions and zones documentation.

Task 2. Create multiple web server instances
For this load balancing scenario, you create three Compute Engine VM instances and install Apache on them, then add a firewall rule that allows HTTP traffic to reach the instances.

The code provided sets the zone to us-east1-c. Setting the tags field lets you reference these instances all at once, such as with a firewall rule. These commands also install Apache on each instance and gives each instance a unique home page.

Create a virtual machine, www1, in your default zone using the following code:

  gcloud compute instances create www1 \
    --zone=us-east1-c \
    --tags=network-lb-tag \
    --machine-type=e2-small \
    --image-family=debian-11 \
    --image-project=debian-cloud \
    --metadata=startup-script='#!/bin/bash
      apt-get update
      apt-get install apache2 -y
      service apache2 restart
      echo "
<h3>Web Server: www1</h3>" | tee /var/www/html/index.html'
Copied!
Create a virtual machine, www2, in your default zone using the following code:

  gcloud compute instances create www2 \
    --zone=us-east1-c \
    --tags=network-lb-tag \
    --machine-type=e2-small \
    --image-family=debian-11 \
    --image-project=debian-cloud \
    --metadata=startup-script='#!/bin/bash
      apt-get update
      apt-get install apache2 -y
      service apache2 restart
      echo "
<h3>Web Server: www2</h3>" | tee /var/www/html/index.html'
Copied!
Create a virtual machine, www3, in your default zone.

  gcloud compute instances create www3 \
    --zone=us-east1-c  \
    --tags=network-lb-tag \
    --machine-type=e2-small \
    --image-family=debian-11 \
    --image-project=debian-cloud \
    --metadata=startup-script='#!/bin/bash
      apt-get update
      apt-get install apache2 -y
      service apache2 restart
      echo "
<h3>Web Server: www3</h3>" | tee /var/www/html/index.html'
Copied!
Create a firewall rule to allow external traffic to the VM instances:

gcloud compute firewall-rules create www-firewall-network-lb \
    --target-tags network-lb-tag --allow tcp:80
Copied!
Now you need to get the external IP addresses of your instances and verify that they are running.

Run the following to list your instances. You'll see their IP addresses in the EXTERNAL_IP column:

gcloud compute instances list
Copied!
Verify that each instance is running with curl, replacing [IP_ADDRESS] with the external IP address for each of your VMs:

curl http://[IP_ADDRESS]
Copied!
Click Check my progress to verify that you've created a group of web servers.

Task 3. Create an Application Load Balancer
Application Load Balancing is implemented on Google Front End (GFE). GFEs are distributed globally and operate together using Google's global network and control plane. You can configure URL rules to route some URLs to one set of instances and route other URLs to other instances.

Requests are always routed to the instance group that is closest to the user, if that group has enough capacity and is appropriate for the request. If the closest group does not have enough capacity, the request is sent to the closest group that does have capacity.

To set up a load balancer with a Compute Engine backend, your VMs need to be in an instance group. The managed instance group provides VMs running the backend servers of an external application load balancer. For this lab, backends serve their own hostnames.

First, create the load balancer template:

gcloud compute instance-templates create lb-backend-template \
   --region=us-east1 \
   --network=default \
   --subnet=default \
   --tags=allow-health-check \
   --machine-type=e2-medium \
   --image-family=debian-11 \
   --image-project=debian-cloud \
   --metadata=startup-script='#!/bin/bash
     apt-get update
     apt-get install apache2 -y
     a2ensite default-ssl
     a2enmod ssl
     vm_hostname="$(curl -H "Metadata-Flavor:Google" \
     http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/name)"
     echo "Page served from: $vm_hostname" | \
     tee /var/www/html/index.html
     systemctl restart apache2'
Copied!
Managed instance groups (MIGs) let you operate apps on multiple identical VMs. You can make your workloads scalable and highly available by taking advantage of automated MIG services, including: autoscaling, autohealing, regional (multiple zone) deployment, and automatic updating.

Create a managed instance group based on the template:

gcloud compute instance-groups managed create lb-backend-group \
   --template=lb-backend-template --size=2 --zone=us-east1-c
Copied!
Create the fw-allow-health-check firewall rule.

gcloud compute firewall-rules create fw-allow-health-check \
  --network=default \
  --action=allow \
  --direction=ingress \
  --source-ranges=130.211.0.0/22,35.191.0.0/16 \
  --target-tags=allow-health-check \
  --rules=tcp:80
Copied!
Note: The ingress rule allows traffic from the Google Cloud health checking systems (130.211.0.0/22 and 35.191.0.0/16). This lab uses the target tag allow-health-check to identify the VMs
Now that the instances are up and running, set up a global static external IP address that your customers use to reach your load balancer:

gcloud compute addresses create lb-ipv4-1 \
  --ip-version=IPV4 \
  --global
Copied!
Notice that the IPv4 address that was reserved:

gcloud compute addresses describe lb-ipv4-1 \
  --format="get(address)" \
  --global
Copied!
Note: Save this IP address, as you need to refer to it later in this lab.
Create a health check for the load balancer (to ensure that only healthy backends are sent traffic):

gcloud compute health-checks create http http-basic-check \
  --port 80
Copied!
Create a backend service:

gcloud compute backend-services create web-backend-service \
  --protocol=HTTP \
  --port-name=http \
  --health-checks=http-basic-check \
  --global
Copied!
Add your instance group as the backend to the backend service:

gcloud compute backend-services add-backend web-backend-service \
  --instance-group=lb-backend-group \
  --instance-group-zone=us-east1-c \
  --global
Copied!
Create a URL map to route the incoming requests to the default backend service:

gcloud compute url-maps create web-map-http \
    --default-service web-backend-service
Copied!
Note: URL map is a Google Cloud configuration resource used to route requests to backend services or backend buckets. For example, with an external Application Load Balancer, you can use a single URL map to route requests to different destinations based on the rules configured in the URL map:
Requests for https://example.com/video go to one backend service.
Requests for https://example.com/audio go to a different backend service.
Requests for https://example.com/images go to a Cloud Storage backend bucket.
Requests for any other host and path combination go to a default backend service.
Create a target HTTP proxy to route requests to your URL map:

gcloud compute target-http-proxies create http-lb-proxy \
    --url-map web-map-http
Copied!
Create a global forwarding rule to route incoming requests to the proxy:

gcloud compute forwarding-rules create http-content-rule \
   --address=lb-ipv4-1\
   --global \
   --target-http-proxy=http-lb-proxy \
   --ports=80
Copied!
Note: A forwarding rule and its corresponding IP address represent the frontend configuration of a Google Cloud load balancer. Learn more about the general understanding of forwarding rules from the Forwarding rules overview guide.

Task 4. Test traffic sent to your instances
On the Google Cloud console in the Search field type Load balancing, then choose Load balancing from the search results.

Click on the load balancer that you just created, web-map-http.

In the Backend section, click on the name of the backend and confirm that the VMs are Healthy. If they are not healthy, wait a few moments and try reloading the page.

When the VMs are healthy, test the load balancer using a web browser, going to http://IP_ADDRESS/, replacing IP_ADDRESS with the load balancer's IP address that you copied previously.

Note: This may take three to five minutes. If you do not connect, wait a minute, and then reload the browser.
Your browser should render a page with content showing the name of the instance that served the page, along with its zone (for example, Page served from: lb-backend-group-xxxx).
