Setup and requirements
Before you click the Start Lab button
Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources are made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
Note: Use an Incognito (recommended) or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents conflicts between your personal account and the student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.
Time to complete the lab—remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
Note: Use only the student account for this lab. If you use a different Google Cloud account, you may incur charges to that account.
How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud console
Click the Start Lab button. If you need to pay for the lab, a dialog opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details pane with the following:

Task 1. Deploy GKE cluster
Run the following to deploy a basic GKE cluster:
gcloud beta container clusters create gmp-cluster --num-nodes=1 --zone us-east4-b --enable-managed-prometheus



gcloud container clusters get-credentials gmp-cluster --zone=us-east4-b



Task 2. Set up a namespace
Create the gmp-test Kubernetes namespace for resources you create as part of the example application:
kubectl create ns gmp-test




Task 3. Deploy the example application
The managed service provides a manifest for an example application that emits Prometheus metrics on its metrics port. The application uses three replicas.

To deploy the example application, run the following command:
kubectl -n gmp-test apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/prometheus-engine/v0.2.3/examples/example-app.yaml



Task 4. Configure a PodMonitoring resource
To ingest the metric data emitted by the example application, you use target scraping. Target scraping and metrics ingestion are configured using Kubernetes custom resources. The managed service uses PodMonitoring custom resources (CRs).

A PodMonitoring CR scrapes targets only in the namespace the CR is deployed in. To scrape targets in multiple namespaces, deploy the same PodMonitoring CR in each namespace. You can verify the PodMonitoring resource is installed in the intended namespace by running kubectl get podmonitoring -A.

For reference documentation about all the Managed Service for Prometheus CRs, see the prometheus-engine/doc/api reference.

The following manifest defines a PodMonitoring resource, prom-example, in the gmp-test namespace. The resource uses a Kubernetes label selector to find all pods in the namespace that have the label app with the value prom-example. The matching pods are scraped on a port named metrics, every 30 seconds, on the /metrics HTTP path.

apiVersion: monitoring.googleapis.com/v1alpha1
kind: PodMonitoring
metadata:
  name: prom-example
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prom-example
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    interval: 30s



To apply this resource, run the following command:
kubectl -n gmp-test apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/prometheus-engine/v0.2.3/examples/pod-monitoring.yaml



Your managed collector is now scraping the matching pods.

To configure horizontal collection that applies to a range of pods across all namespaces, use the ClusterPodMonitoring resource. The ClusterPodMonitoring resource provides the same interface as the PodMonitoring resource but does not limit discovered pods to a given namespace.

Note: An additional targetLabels field provides a simplified Prometheus-style relabel configuration. You can use relabeling to add pod labels as labels on the ingested time series. You can't overwrite the mandatory target labels; for a list of these labels, see the prometheus_target resource.
If you are running on GKE, then you can do the following:

To query the metrics ingested by the example application, see Query data from the Prometheus service.
To learn about filtering exported metrics and adapting your prom-operator resources, see Additional topics for managed collection.
Task 5. Download the prometheus binary
Download the prometheus binary from the following bucket:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/prometheus && cd prometheus



git checkout v2.28.1-gmp.4



wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kochasoft/gsp1026/prometheus



chmod a+x prometheus



Task 6. Run the prometheus binary
Save your project id to a variable:
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)



Save your zone to a variable. These values will be used when running your promtheus binary.
export ZONE=us-east4-b



Run the prometheus binary on cloud shell using command here:
./prometheus \
  --config.file=documentation/examples/prometheus.yml --export.label.project-id=$PROJECT_ID --export.label.location=$ZONE 



After the prometheus binary begins you should be able to go to managed prometheus in the Console UI and run a PromQL query “up” to see the prometheus binary is available (will show localhost running one as the instance name).

Task 7. Download and run the node exporter
Open a new tab in Cloud Shell to run the node_exporter commands.

Download and run the exporter on the cloud shell box:

wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.3.1/node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz



 tar xvfz node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz



cd node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64



 ./node_exporter



Note: The port that the node_exporter tool is running on you will use to modify the config of prometheus on the next few steps.
You should see output like this indicating that the Node Exporter is now running and exposing metrics on port 9100:

ts=2023-03-01T10:27:17.262Z caller=node_exporter.go:199 level=info msg="Listening on" address=:9100
ts=2023-03-01T10:27:17.263Z caller=tls_config.go:195 level=info msg="TLS is disabled." http2=false
Create a config.yaml file
Stop the running prometheus binary in the 1st tab of Cloud Shell and have a new config file which will take the metrics from node exporter:
vi config.yaml



Create a config.yaml file with the following spec:
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: node
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']



Upload the config.yaml file you created to verify:
export PROJECT=$(gcloud config get-value project)



gsutil mb -p $PROJECT gs://$PROJECT



gsutil cp config.yaml gs://$PROJECT



gsutil -m acl set -R -a public-read gs://$PROJECT




Re-run prometheus pointing to the new configuration file by running the command below:
./prometheus --config.file=config.yaml --export.label.project-id=$PROJECT --export.label.location=$ZONE

Use the following stat from the exporter to see its count in a PromQL query.

In Cloud Shell, click on the web preview icon.
web_preview

Set the port to 9090 by selecting Change Preview Port and preview by clicking Change and Preview.
Write any query in the PromQL query Editor prefixed with “node_”. This should bring up an input list of metrics you can select to visualize in the graphical editor.

"node_cpu_seconds_total" provides graphical data.
node_export

Try selecting other metrics that appear to view the data exported.
